This is a social media site the utilizes Spotify's API to let users add a clip from any song to their posts. You can follow your friends, like their posts, and create your own posts for everyone to see. No need for a new username/password, just sign in with your existing Spotify account!

<h3> Stack </h3> 
  
This project was developed with MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS.
Both the frontend and backend are being hosted on Heroku. Because, of this, the servers might take 10 to 30 seconds to start up.

<h3> Why did I make this project? </h3> 
  
I created this project for two main reasons: First, I wanted to get more practice with React. I have experience with small react projects, and I have some experience working with a large, professional React codebase, but I had yet to create my a large react project on my own. The second reason was that I wanted to show the use of a third party API. Spotify has a really cool API, and it let me bring my idea of a social media that incorporates music to life.
